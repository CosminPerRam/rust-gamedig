# 0.0.1 - 16/09/2022
The first usable version of the crate, yay!  
It brings:
- Initial implementation of the [valve server query protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries).
- Initial [Team Fortress 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2) support.

# 0.0.0 - 15/09/2022
The first *markdown*, the crate is unusable as it doesn't contain anything helpful.
