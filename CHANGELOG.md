# 0.0.2 - 20/10/2022
Further implementation of the Valve protocol (PLAYERS and RULES queries).  
[Counter Strike: Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/) implementation.  
[The Ship](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/The_Ship) implementation.  
The library now has error handling.

# 0.0.1 - 16/10/2022
The first usable version of the crate, yay!  
It brings:  
Initial implementation of the [Valve server query protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries).  
Initial [Team Fortress 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2) support.

# 0.0.0 - 15/10/2022
The first *markdown*, the crate is unusable as it doesn't contain anything helpful.
